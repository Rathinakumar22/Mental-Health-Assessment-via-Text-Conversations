Problem Statement:
Mental health issues like depression and anxiety are often underdiagnosed due to social stigma or lack of access to professional help. Early detection could provide better outcomes for individuals. This application will use NLP to analyze text-based conversations to predict potential mental health issues.

Objective:
Design an NLP application that analyzes user-generated text data to predict potential mental health conditions such as depression, anxiety, or stress. The focus is on understanding context, sentiment, and emotions in the user's language.

Features:
- Sentiment Analysis: Detect positive, negative, or neutral emotions in text.
- Emotion Detection: Classify emotions such as sadness, anger, joy, and fear.
- Depression/Anxiety Markers: Identify patterns indicating mental health issues.
- Conversational Interface: Enable ongoing conversation with the system.
- Resource Suggestions: Provide mental health resources based on severity.

Technologies used:
- NLP Libraries: NLTK, SpaCy, Hugging Face Transformers
- Pre-trained Models: BERT
- Emotion/Sentiment Analysis: Vader, TextBlob
- Front-end: Web/Mobile Interface
- Back-end: Flask/Django for API service

Steps:
- Data Collection
- Pre-processing
- Model Training
- Evaluation
- UI Development
- Deployment
